samples-dynamic_nav_builder-javascript
======================================

This javascript was written as part of an application/tool which allows users to visually create xml that is later parsed and turned into site navigation for the end user. Navigation nodes can be created/edited/deleted and dragged and dropped onto the navigation tree GUI. This was done with prototype and scrip-tac-ulous.
